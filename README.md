# 3-Daily-Programs
A repository where I code 3 programs everyday.
This repository contains a collection of Python programs, each designed to illustrate specific programming concepts and practices. The journey starts from basic concepts and gradually moves to more complex and practical applications.

## Day 1

### Program 1: Hello World
**Concepts Covered**: 
- Basic syntax
- `print()` function

**Description**: 
A simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

### Program 2: Simple Calculator
**Concepts Covered**: 
- Arithmetic operations
- User input

## Day 2

### Program 1: List Manipulation
**Concepts Covered**: 
- Lists
- Adding/removing elements
- Slicing

**Description**: 
Demonstrates various list operations including adding, removing, and slicing elements.

### Program 2: Using Loops for Pattern Printing
**Concepts Covered**: 
- `range()` for loop iteration
- Nested loops
- `print()` function's `end` parameter

**Description**: 
Uses nested loops to print a simple pattern, demonstrating how loops can be used for creating repeated patterns or sequences.

### Program 3: Dictionary Operations
**Concepts Covered**:
