# 3-Daily-Programs
A repository where I code 3 programs everyday.
This repository contains a collection of Python programs, each designed to illustrate specific programming concepts and practices. The journey starts from basic concepts and gradually moves to more complex and practical applications.

## Day 1

### Program 1: Hello World
**Concepts Covered**: 
- Basic syntax
- `print()` function

**Description**: 
A simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

### Program 2: Simple Calculator
**Concepts Covered**: 
- Arithmetic operations
- User input
- Variables

**Description**: 
A basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.

### Program 3: File Handling
**Concepts Covered**: 
- File I/O
- Context managers

**Description**: 
A program that writes a message to a file and then reads it back.

## Day 2

### Program 1: List Manipulation
**Concepts Covered**: 
- Lists
- Adding/removing elements
- Slicing

**Description**: 
Demonstrates various list operations including adding, removing, and slicing elements.

### Program 2: Using Loops for Pattern Printing
**Concepts Covered**: 
- `range()` for loop iteration
- Nested loops
- `print()` function's `end` parameter

**Description**: 
Uses nested loops to print a simple pattern, demonstrating how loops can be used for creating repeated patterns or sequences.

### Program 3: Dictionary Operations
**Concepts Covered**: 
- Creating and modifying dictionaries
- Accessing and deleting elements
- Looping through a dictionary using `.items()`

**Description**: 
Shows basic dictionary operations like adding, removing, and accessing elements in a dictionary.

## Day 3

### Program 1: String Manipulation - Palindrome Checker
**Concepts Covered**: 
- String manipulation (cleaning and processing strings)
- Slicing strings to reverse them
- Understanding palindromes

**Description**: 
A program that checks if a given string is a palindrome, accounting for spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

### Program 2: Basic File Handling - File Content Reverser
**Concepts Covered**: 
- Reading from and writing to files
- Reversing string data

**Description**: 
Reads content from a file, reverses it, and writes the reversed content into a new file. Demonstrates file I/O and string manipulation.

### Program 3: Simple Algorithm - Fibonacci Sequence Generator
**Concepts Covered**: 
- Basic algorithm implementation
- Using a while loop for iteration
- Working with sequences (lists)

**Description**: 
Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number, showcasing basic algorithm design and list manipulation in Python.
